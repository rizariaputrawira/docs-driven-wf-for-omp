# Animation diff review

Read [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md) and `skill://animate/references/principles.md`. Require a real supplied or discovered diff and a bounded review request. Inspect changed code plus necessary context, project tokens and documented design decisions. Do not manufacture a diff or expand to whole-app audit.

Review purpose/frequency, timing, physicality/origin, interruption, performance, accessibility and cohesion. Cite actual `file:line` evidence and distinguish observed behavior from source risks and unverified feel. Respect justified drawer timing; ordinary delay and missing reduced-motion behavior require separate analysis. Compatible project tokens override fallback example values.

Report a Before/After/Why table with line anchors, then group relevant commentary by consumer impact, simplification, performance, interruption, origin/cohesion and accessibility. Honor requested output formats. A clean review is valid; do not invent findings.

Close with a review verdict: `Block` for grounded material motion defects or `Approve` when none is established within checked scope. These are review judgments, never native approval, execution authority or whole-app assurance. No source/plan writes, dependency installs or automatic corrections. For uncertain feel, recommend actual playback/device checks without claiming to have performed them.
