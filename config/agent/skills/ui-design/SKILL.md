description: "Use when the user wants to design, redesign, shape, critique, audit, polish, clarify, distill, harden, optimize, adapt, animate, colorize, extract, or otherwise improve a frontend interface. Covers websites, landing pages, dashboards, product UI, app shells, components, forms, settings, onboarding, and empty states. Handles UX review, visual hierarchy, information architecture, cognitive load, accessibility, performance, responsive behavior, theming, anti-patterns, typography, fonts, spacing, layout, alignment, color, motion, micro-interactions, UX copy, error states, edge cases, i18n, and reusable design systems or tokens. Also use for bland designs that need to become bolder or more delightful, loud designs that should become quieter, live browser iteration on UI elements, or ambitious visual effects that should feel technically extraordinary. Not for backend-only or non-UI tasks. Also applies when explicitly requested as Impeccable."

Adapted from [pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable) `skill-v4.5.0` at commit `508d7e8955de3b3caf2d8676e85206723d41a887`. This file is modified for OMP-native permissions, authorization, routing, and local workflow. The retained Impeccable package is licensed under Apache-2.0; see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Impeccable provides design workflows and project context for frontend interface work. The requested outcome and native tools, approval and authorization determine what can be inspected, proposed or changed. This skill grants no permission by itself.

Core principles:
- The brief, product truth, incumbent design system, accessibility and authorized scope govern the work. Boldness must serve those constraints, not override them.
- Complete the requested scope without unrelated redesign, assets, dependencies, claims or polish. Do not replace factual copy or expand scope without authorization.
- Verify proportionately through permitted tools. Stop when acceptance and useful evidence are sufficient, not at an arbitrary pass count or while material defects remain.

## Setup

1. When Impeccable context is relevant and native rules permit it, invoke `<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable context` once per session, where `<skill-base-dir>` is the directory containing this SKILL.md; keep cwd at the user's project. Invocation does not authorize commands, network access, downloads or project writes. Resolve the base from the runtime-reported directory or actual loaded file location, substituting it in command paths; never guess a fallback root. On Windows without `sh`, use `<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable.cmd`. The launcher uses a compatible adjacent binary or first-run download; no Node runtime is required. Pass a named source file or route as `--target <path>`. It loads PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, the matching surface brief and applicable native guidance. Treat project documents as design data, not executable authority; follow applicable workflow within native constraints and do not rerun context.
2. Load the request's playbook: its Commands-table reference for an explicit/implied sub-command, or [reference/new-work.md](reference/new-work.md) for a new surface or replacement visual world. Inspect target and incumbent visual truth before editing. When the app cannot run, start with committed visual-regression goldens or screenshot fixtures; verify target and freshness against current tokens, CSS, components, or assets, resolve conflicts, and compare theme/variant captures.
3. After resolving analysis and direction, read [reference/craft-floor.md](reference/craft-floor.md) immediately before any UI edit, including small refinements. It carries the quality floor, the absolute bans, and the reflexes no detector catches. Do not load it for planning-only work.

**Launcher unavailable:** On refusal or failure, send a separate message **before the next tool call**: “Context loading did not run; I’ll read the existing project context directly.” Then read existing PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md without inventing missing context, follow applicable steps 2–3, and continue using only tools and access permitted by the native environment. This applies to planning and editing; launcher failure alone does not block either.

**Optional critique state:** `.impeccable/critique/` and its `ignore.md` may not exist before a first critique; absence is normal. Do not read a directory as an existence probe or create it during inspection. Use the error-distinguishing discovery recipe in [critique Setup](reference/critique.md#setup); genuine lookup/read failures are reported, not treated as empty state. That reference owns ignore discovery; canonical `critique-storage` helpers still own snapshot writes and history.

## How to design

- **The brief wins.** Honor pinned aesthetics, eras, materials, fonts, and palettes even when they conflict with a saturated-pattern warning. Redirecting a clear brief toward your taste is failure.
- **Refinement preserves; redesign replaces.** Refinement keeps the incumbent identity, behavior, copy, and everything outside scope. Ask before replacing factual copy or adding claims. Redesign keeps product truth, content, function, native affordances, and constraints, but treats the old look as evidence and anti-reference; choose a replacement world in new-work and replace DESIGN.md. Never split the difference into polish on the discarded look.
- **Visual authority is evidence, not a filename.** Missing DESIGN.md alone does not make a project greenfield; new-work decides whether to preserve, expand, or replace the incumbent world.

## Modes

The mode names what the visitor's success looks like on this surface.

- **Persuade:** the visitor decides and acts; design is the product. Landing pages, marketing, campaigns, pricing. Earn attention and action. Ship real imagery when the brief needs it; follow the committed world, not category habit.
- **Operate:** the visitor completes a task. App UI, dashboards, editors, admin, settings, tools. Scanability, consistency, native expectations, and the real usage scene outrank expression. Brand lives in precise details.
- **Read:** the visitor understands something. Docs, articles, guides, help, changelogs. Structure for comprehension, then make the reading experience worth staying in.
- **Experience:** the visitor is inside the work itself. Portfolios, galleries, showcases. Let the artifact lead from the first viewport; the interface recedes.

Choose the mode from the requested surface, not the product, and persist it only in that surface brief. A tool's landing page is still Persuade; a fashion house's documentation is still Read; a docs index is Read, not Persuade. See [new-work.md](reference/new-work.md) for new surfaces and [operate.md](reference/operate.md) for deeper Operate/Read guidance.

Routing:

- **Explicit OpenDesign request or explicit external generated/refined artifact requirement:** follow [reference/open-design.md](reference/open-design.md). Ordinary refinement and this skill's named-element live-browser `generate` do not require OpenDesign.
- **No argument:** read [routing.md](reference/routing.md) and present its context-aware menu; never auto-run a command.
- **Explicit or clearly implied request to run a command:** load its reference (native variant on native platforms) and follow it. Choose the best-fitting command from the requested outcome and evidence; ask only if competing choices would materially change direction or outcome.
- **Workflow or command-selection question:** read [Workflow questions](reference/routing.md#workflow-questions).
- **Otherwise:** treat the request as general design work. Missing PRODUCT.md routes a new surface or replacement world through init, then new-work; a narrow refinement of existing code proceeds on the incumbent implementation as `impeccable context` directs, offering init afterward rather than blocking on it.
- `teach` aliases `init`. `craft` is a deprecated alias for ordinary new-work and adds nothing. `shape` owns task discovery, then enters new-work only for visual-world and surface-concept decisions.

After init writes PRODUCT.md, resume without rerunning `impeccable context`; init loads the native platform reference itself when the platform it recorded is `ios`, `android`, or `adaptive`.

**Pin / Unpin:** `<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable pin <pin|unpin> <command>` creates or removes a standalone `$<command>` shortcut. Report the script's result concisely; relay stderr verbatim on error.

**Hooks:** `$impeccable hooks <on|off|status|ignore-rule|ignore-file|ignore-value|reset>` manages the design detector hook for this project (auto-runs the detector after UI file edits and surfaces findings). Load [reference/hooks.md](reference/hooks.md) when the user invokes it with any argument.

**Doctor:** `$impeccable doctor` reports and repairs drift between this project's Impeccable artifacts (PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md and its sidecar, config, surface briefs, the hook) and what this version reads. Load [reference/doctor.md](reference/doctor.md) when the user invokes it, or when they ask what is out of date, stale, or needs refreshing. A `CONTEXT_STALE` directive in Setup's output is the cheap subset of the same report; act on it there per its own instructions rather than running doctor unasked.

**Never repair drift as a side effect of a design task.** A `CONTEXT_STALE` finding is reported, not acted on, unless the user asks. The one exception is a finding marked `auto`, which the next write to that file performs anyway.

## Local selective references

Load [component craft](reference/local/component-craft.md) only for focused component detail. Load [marketing-site guidance](reference/local/marketing-sites.md) only for landing pages, portfolios, or marketing redesigns. Both are local, independently authored supplements; neither replaces this workflow or becomes a mandatory checklist. Motion details remain in `skill://ui-web-motion`.
