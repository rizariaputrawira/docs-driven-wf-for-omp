| Exact pinned upstream path | Local file | Substantive mechanism |

| Same pinned `skills/skill-inspector/SKILL.md` | `references/intake-checklist.md` | Inventory instruction/script/dependency/MCP surfaces; trace actual sensitive access/transmission/execution/persistence; compare necessary bounded authority with user control. |

Both adapted procedure files prominently identify modification and NVIDIA attribution. Modified for OMP native permissions and passive source-only inspection: manual source review is default; only already-supplied scanner output is supplemental; exact verdicts are `acceptable`, `caution`, `unsafe`, `analysis-incomplete`; decisive gaps prohibit acceptable while substantiated unsafe behavior remains reportable. Added package manifest/runtime import/host contract/dependency inspection, actual coverage accounting, and cross-owner candidate lifecycle links.

Removed: clone/download, scanner commands, tool/dependency/runtime installation, scanner-first requirement, shell-tool aliases, numeric score thresholds, APPROVE/install-posture assertions, lower-confidence fallback rhetoric and report ornament prescriptions. Native OMP permissions/approval and existing read tools control actual actions; no upstream model/provider directive is adopted. Missing material is reported, not silently replaced or fetched by a target-inspecting reviewer.

## Notices and exclusions

The pinned repository root tree contains no file named `NOTICE`. Its [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillSpector/blob/35270064e42230dbc566e4134c55b5d581355db3/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) was inspected: notices cover scanner runtime dependencies (including typer, rich, httpx, PyYAML, pydantic, OpenAI/LangChain and YARA), none of which are redistributed in this adaptation. No scanner source, dependency, YARA rule, installer, CI action, executable or extension is copied. Thus those dependency notices are research-only, not this passive skill's redistributed components. The source SKILL contains no additional copyright/patent/trademark notice beyond the pertinent attribution preserved here and the full license.

The shared lifecycle and managed security-reviewer definition are original authored integration contracts from the approved plan, not copied NVIDIA runtime/scanner assets. Linked audit companions are owned by `security-audit`; their source bodies/notices are not duplicated here. Intake verdict is not install approval, vulnerability absence or runtime assurance.
